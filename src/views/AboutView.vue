        <p class="card-text">from as young as 14 years old I have always had a "thing" for computers and everything Tech, at 15 I went to a school that taught CAT(Computer Applications Technology. My love for computers grew from there. At some point I wanted to do IT but I had a change of heart when I discovered Coding in 2020 at 17 years old, since then I have never looked back. I consider myself a visionary and innovator whose vision is inline with the future. I have big dreams for the future, dreams that when fully manifested will change the course of history. There's curently a steady rise to the tech industry and I believe that technology truly is the future.</p>
